## üîã Getting Started

1. Setup your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Head over to [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) to claim for a free API Key.
3. Clone this repository by running this command:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gyz15/dc-stonk-bot
   ```
4. Install the dependencies by running this command:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
5. Create a KV namespace by using the following command,:
   ```bash
    wrangler kv:namespace create "CONFIG"
   ```
   Copy the id of the KV namespace and replace the original id in [`wrangler.toml`](./wrangler.toml).  
   Then, run this command to store the API Key in the KV namespace. Replace the "<API_KEY>" with the key generated in step 2.
   ```bash
    wrangler kv:key put --binding=CONFIG API_KEY <API_KEY>
   ```
6. These fields in [`wrangler.toml`](./wrangler.toml) should be edited.

   ```
    (Required)
    account_id="<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    kv_namespaces = [
        { binding = "CONFIG",id = "<NEW_KV_NAMESPACE_ID>" }
    ]

    (Optional)
    name="<CUSTOM_NAME>"
   ```

7. Head over to ['Discord Developer Portal'](https://discord.com/developers) to create a new application. Copy the "APPLICATION ID" and "PUBLIC KEY". Edit these field in [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts).
8. By using the following command, put the APPLICATION_SECRET of your discord application into your worker:
   ```bash
    wrangler secret put APPLICATION_SECRET
   ```
9. You're all set and run the following command to publish your bot.
   ```bash
    wrangler publish
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏èError I ran in: "APPLICATION_SECRET not defined". Able to solve it by changing the variable to a random string, after successfully publish run step 8 and 9 again(change the string back to variable).
10. Copy the url of your bot. Head over to the Discord Developer Portal and add "<YOUR_BOT_URL>/interaction" as the interaction endpoint url. E.g. "https://dc-stonk-bot.workers.dev/interaction"
11. Head over to "<YOUR_BOT_URL>/setup" to register the command. Note that it might return an error but it will still work. (Idk why that's happeningü•¥)
12. Head over to "<YOUR_BOT_URL>/" to authorize and add the bot to the server. Wait for about 10-15 minutes before the slash command is registered.

### üë© üíª Developing

Feel free to edit the code based on your needs in [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts). Please be note that by enabling the bot to return both **annually and quarterly data** in a response might cause an error (Message character count > 2000)
